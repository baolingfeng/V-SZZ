# How to run our adapted version of OpenSZZ

We adapted the original version of OpenSZZ (see below) to exclude Jira issue filter. We use our Developer-informed Oracle as input to OpenSZZ.
The python script `run_openszz.py` systematically copy a -pre-cloned repository and run the precompiled `openszz.jar`

`python3 run_openszz.py szz/cloned json-inpit-raw/bugfix_commits_all.json szz/openSZZ/`

Where:
 - `szz/cloned` is a folder containing all repository pre-cloned, The python script makes a copy of this repository to prevents excessive clones;
 - `json-inpit-raw/bugfix_commits_all.json` is a JSON format input containing the list of fixes to analyze;
 - `szz/openSZZ/` is the working directory where repositories will be copied and where OpenSZZ expects and produces data.

Below the original content of README.md of OpenSZZ for more details.

# OpenSZZ
OpenSZZ  is  our open source implementation of the SZZ Algorithm [1] to calculate the <i>BugInducingCommits</i> of any project using Git as versioning system and Jira as issue tracker. 
A cloud-native version is available on the [OpenSZZ-Cloud-Native repository](https://github.com/clowee/OpenSZZ-cloud-native)

A dataset including the analysis of 33 projects, has been published in 2019 [2]. 

The current version can tag commits in github with the faults reported in Jira. 


## Download
Release 0.1

## Usage: 
1. Clone the GitHub Repository 

2. Download the faults from Jira: 
     
     szz.jar -d jiraUrtl jiraKey
     
     eg: szz.jar https://issues.apache.org/jira AMBARI
     
     The script saves the file faults.csv containing the issues reported in Jira  

3. Save gitLogsMap 
     
     szz.jar -l gitRepositoryPath
   
     e.g. szz.jar -l ./projects/ambari 
      
     This script saves the file gitlog.csv containing the parsed gitlog with all the information needed to execute szz

4. Map Faults to commits
      
      szz.jar -m jiraKey
     
     the script takes in input the files generated before (faults.csv and gitlog.csv) and generate the final result in the file FaultInducingCommits.csv
      
      
## Usage [alternative]:
This command executes all the steps at once: 
* szz.jar -all githubUrl jiraUrl jiraKey
 
The script first clones the gitHub repository, then download the Jira faults, and finally maps faults to commits.
